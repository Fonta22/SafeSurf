<!-- # URL Assessment Criteria

## Traffic Volume Ranking
Most authentic websites are usually have good traffic volumne. -->
<!-- 
A Research-Oriented Top Sites Ranking Hardened Against Manipulation. This list aggregates the top 1M ranks from the lists provided by Alexa, Umbrella, Majestic, and Farsight from 16 February 2023 to 17 March 2023 (30 days). 
May be later we can integrate tranco into code instead of using the CSV to always get the latest 1M list.
